# GameVista

## Introduction

For this project, I tried to use frameworks that are as widely adopted as possible.

For the web interface, I used NextJS. I built out the ui using components from shadcn.

For the api, I went with a standard Express server.

Out of the box, we offer support for Postgres and Sqlite3. We are planning on adding support for other databases if requested.

## Requirements

1. Docker
2. Docker Compose
3. Node (^22.12.0)
4. Git

## Functionality

1. Define analytics structures
   - Create database schemas / tables
   - Create matching endpoints to perform crud operations on created schemas
2. View analytics data from dashboard.

Define Database connections

## User Story

Define a database connection -> create a new analytics object -> set up their game to hit the api endpoint -> view / manage their data from their web interface.
